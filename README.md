# Project Description #

The purpose of this project is to extract information from sections A, B, and C of the CNAE (National Classification of Economic Activities) from the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) website, save this information in an excel file, and then process this data into a table using a Python script.

The Python script is written in version 3.10 and requires the openpyxl and unidecode libraries to function properly.

There is a folder called API within the project that contains a Python API capable of reading the data from the excel file and writing it to a SQLite database through the "/CNAE_infos" endpoint. The API also allows for data retrieval through the same endpoint. The flask and openpyxl libraries are required for the API to function properly.

## API ##
## Endpoint: /CNAE_infos ##

### POST ###

### GET ###

This endpoint requests and returns a JSON response containing all data from the database.

## Requirements ##

* openpyxl
* unidecode
* flask

You can install the requirements using the command:
### pip install -r requirements.txt ###
Make sure you are using this command at the "requirements.txt" folder

Please remember to include the library patch and patch of your python directory in the input of the Python Scope in the transaction processing of the project workflow
